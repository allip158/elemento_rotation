# GBM organoid scRNA-seq Rotation Project
### Elemento Lab
Note: main R scripts for analysis. Plotting scripts in the form of jupyter notebook are coming soon.

#### Project 1. Align All
* Scripts for filtering and QC steps
* Scripts for aligning by sample or all samples together (incl. Xenograft)

#### Project 2. TCGA Gene Sets
* Scripts to perform subset analysis on 4 GBM Subtypes as defined by TCGA paper: Proneural, Neural, Classical, Mesenchymal

#### Project 3. Tirosh Gene Sets
* Scripts to perform stemness/lineage analysis as well as cell cycle analysis using gene sets defined in Tirosh et al. (2016)

#### Project 4. Incorporate Bulk Analysis
* Scripts related to processing bulk RNA-seq for sample 1258

#### Project 5. CNV Analysis
* Scripts to preprocess GTEX data for use with Broad's InferCNV

#### Project 6. Differential Analysis
* Scripts to plot differential gene expression between conditions
